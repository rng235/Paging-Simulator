FAQ:
——————————————————————————————————————

1. How to run the program?
	a.	Before compiling and running please have the pager exe in the same directory as the random-numbers.txt
	b.  Compiling should look something like g++ main.cpp pager.cpp
	c.	There is ONLY ONE possible arguments to pass into the program when running.
	    1. <input-filename> <M> <P> <S> <J> <N> <R> <D>
	d.	The program should run successfully and display the output on the terminal (standard output).

2. What is verbose mode? -- passing 1 as the last argument*
    - When verbose mode is activated, it will display all of the cycles involved
    in a particular algorithm. This is especially useful when debugging the program.
    It indicates the process, reference word, the page, program time,
    hit or miss, eviction and the page being evicted.
